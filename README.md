# ManualNameSniper
Due to recent experiences with the MojangAPI breaking and not allowing programmers to interact with it, this program was creating to give continuity to Name Sniping.

## Installation

> Click [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/a85x4pyqn4agele/ManualSniper.zip/file).
>
> Download the .zip file
>
> Extract the file, and run either main.py or the binary version.

*Do not mess with the src folder, everything needs to be run from within it. If you want to move the binary file around or any of the files within, create a shortcut.*

## Usage

- Open the settings.txt file, and insert your Minecraft E-mail, password, and the username to be sniped in the correct fields.

> If you want to run the main.py version of the program, move all the python files into `src`.

- Run the binary version or main.py -> Do this within the src folder! (Upon running, you'll be presented with a terminal and browser, depending if you're running it through main.py or the binary version.
- Pay attention to the terminal with the log messages and instructions.
- When the browser asks for the Captcha, solve it, and then head over to the terminal and press ENTER.
- Everything else is done automatically, just let it run until snipe time!
